# Getting started with the example connector

A connector is composed of 3 main things:
* the manifest describes the connector and its configuration panels in the GUI
* the index.js is where the code goes to implement *capabilities* the connector provides
* the package.json is the usual nodeJS dependency management affair

# Starting the connector
Click on the fourth icon from the top in the left navbar ( Run and Debug )
Once the drawer opens, at the top of the drawer there should be a little green "play" button icon, click it.
You will see the logs of your connector in the terminal

# Try it in a flow
